Overview
This project implements a Real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Windows, leveraging Machine Learning techniques to detect network intrusions. The system uses:

Supervised Learning: Random Forest model for identifying known attacks from CICIDS 2018 & SCVIC-APT databases.
Unsupervised Learning: Autoencoder model for anomaly detection.
